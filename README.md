# Save your favourite books

This was an assignment for the JavaScript - DOM portion of my coding bootcamp. It allows a user to save their favourite books to a list.

**Stack used**: HTML - SCSS - Sass - JavaScript

## The brief

These were the detailed instructions for the assignment:

- Create a webpage that can be used to let a user store information about a catalogue of books.
- The user should be able to add information (e.g. author, title, genre, reviews, etc.) about their favourite books.
- All the information about all the books added by the user should be listed on the webpage.
- The user should also be able to remove or edit information for a book.
